# SemiprimeCalculations
High level summary:
Generate sieve for as many numbers as you want to test, store the results as a binary string, or encode the information into 64 bits for future refrence.

set up configs in runTesting to determine how many threads and integers to test

double check file sources in runTesting and testing.py

ONCE ALL IS SET UP, run `python3 runtesting.py` to start generating results

`TODO: command line, add classes for extensibility, parallelize the sieve method`


-----
Step 1, semiprimesieve.py

Step 2, add options in runTesting.py

Step 3, double check file sources in both runtesting and testing.py

Encoding comes from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5940416/compress-a-series-of-1s-and-0s-into-the-shortest-possible-ascii-string
